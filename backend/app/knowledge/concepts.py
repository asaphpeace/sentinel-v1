Concept Cards — PAIN_POINT_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md Pain 2. Not a separate course:
a short, dismissible explanation attached to the exact UI element that
caused real confusion in the training calls, rendered with the customer's
own current values substituted in rather than a generic glossary entry.

Distinct from app/knowledge/dmarc.py etc (which the AI advisor cites) —
these are rendered directly in the UI as a card, no LLM involved.
