            <h3>Creating your account</h3>
            <p>Registering requires agreeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy — your account starts <strong>unverified</strong> until you confirm your email via the link sent at signup. You can use the app immediately either way; verification is a dismissible reminder, not a login gate. See <a href="#" @click.prevent="activeSection = 'account-security'">Account &amp; Security</a> for the full detail on verification, password recovery, and what changing your password does to your active session.</p>

            <h3>What Sentinel protects</h3>
            <p>Sentinel monitors two independent email security standards that address different attack vectors:</p>
            <div class="two-col">
              <div class="info-card">
                <div class="ic-head">DMARC</div>
                <p>Stops domain spoofing — attackers sending email that appears to come from your domain. DMARC tells receiving mail servers what to do with unauthenticated mail: monitor it (<code>p=none</code>), send it to spam (<code>p=quarantine</code>), or reject it outright (<code>p=reject</code>).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="info-card">
                <div class="ic-head">MTA-STS & TLS</div>
                <p>Stops downgrade attacks — interception of inbound email by stripping TLS encryption. MTA-STS tells sending mail servers that they must use TLS to deliver to your mail host and that the certificate must be valid.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>These two tracks are complementary. DMARC protects your outbound reputation; MTA-STS protects your inbound delivery channel. A fully hardened domain has both at enforcement.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Adding your first domain</h3>
            <p>Click <strong>Add domain</strong> in the sidebar. The wizard runs in three steps:</p>
            <div class="steps">
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">1</span><div><strong>Enter your domain names.</strong> You can add multiple domains at once. Sentinel checks whether a DMARC record already exists in DNS.</div></div>
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">2</span><div><strong>Publish the DMARC record.</strong> Sentinel generates the exact TXT record to add to your DNS at <code>_dmarc.yourdomain.com</code>. The record includes your unique reporting address so aggregate reports are routed to Sentinel.</div></div>
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">3</span><div><strong>Optionally set up MTA-STS.</strong> Sentinel generates the TLS-RPT and MTA-STS DNS records and the policy file. You can skip this step and return later — DMARC setup is the priority.</div></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>The reporting address</h3>
            <p>Each domain gets a unique address in the form <code>abc123@mailsentry.co.za</code>. This address must appear in the DMARC <code>rua=</code> tag and/or the TLS-RPT <code>rua=</code> tag of your published DNS records. When Sentinel finds it in DNS, the domain is marked ownership-verified and aggregate reports will be attributed to your workspace.</p>
            <div class="callout info">
              <strong>Why a unique address per domain?</strong> It lets Sentinel identify which workspace owns which domain without requiring you to log into a third-party report processor. It also enables ownership transfer — if you move a domain between workspaces, you update the address in DNS.
            </div>
            <p>If your DMARC record was published before adding the domain to Sentinel, add the reporting address to your existing <code>rua=</code> tag as a second address:</p>
            <div class="code-block"><pre>v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:reports@yourdmarc.com,mailto:abc123@mailsentry.co.za;</pre></div>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>When data appears</h3>
            <p>DMARC aggregate reports are sent by receiving mail servers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.) once every 24 hours covering the previous day's mail. After you publish your DMARC record:</p>
            <div class="timeline-list">
              <div class="tl-row"><span class="tl-time">24–48 hours</span><span>First aggregate reports arrive from major mail providers</span></div>
              <div class="tl-row"><span class="tl-time">3–7 days</span><span>Enough data to see your primary sending sources and their alignment status</span></div>
              <div class="tl-row"><span class="tl-time">30 days</span><span>Sufficient history to make a confident policy advancement decision</span></div>
            </div>
            <p>Until reports arrive, the Analytics page will show no data. This is normal — there is nothing wrong with your setup.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Understanding your first Sentinel Score</h3>
            <p>The score (0–100) reflects the overall security posture of your domain portfolio across three pillars:</p>
            <div class="pillar-list">
              <div class="pillar"><span class="pl-max">60 pts</span><strong>DMARC enforcement</strong> — where you are on the none → quarantine → reject journey</div>

              <div class="pillar"><span class="pl-max">15 pts</span><strong>Certificate health</strong> — whether MX host certificates are valid and not expiring</div>
            </div>
            <p>A new domain starting at <code>p=none</code> with no MTA-STS will score near zero. That's expected. The score exists to track progress, not to judge you on day one.</p>
            <p>See <a href="#" @click.prevent="activeSection = 'score-ref'">Sentinel Score Reference</a> for the exact point breakdown.</p>

                <p>No action is taken on unauthenticated mail. Reports are collected. Anyone can still send email that appears to come from your domain. This is a data-collection phase only — do not stay here longer than necessary.</p>

                <p>Unauthenticated mail is delivered to the recipient's spam folder. Your legitimate mail is still delivered — senders that pass SPF or DKIM alignment are unaffected. This stage exposes any senders you missed during monitoring.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="stage-card stage-r">
                <div class="sc-head"><span class="sc-badge badge-r">p=reject</span> Full enforcement</div>
                <p>Unauthenticated mail is refused by the receiving server and never delivered. This is the only policy that fully protects your domain against impersonation. Everything before this is preparation.</p>

                <p>Once at reject, you can publish a BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) record. This displays your logo in the sender column of supporting email clients (Gmail, Yahoo). Not yet tracked by Sentinel but enabled by a clean reject posture.</p>

            <h3>SPF alignment explained</h3>
            <p>DMARC checks alignment, not just whether SPF or DKIM passed. Alignment means the domain in the authentication result must match the domain in the message's <code>From:</code> header.</p>
            <div class="two-col">
              <div class="info-card">
                <div class="ic-head good-head">Aligned — passes DMARC</div>
                <p>Envelope-from: <code>noreply@example.com</code><br>Header From: <code>example.com</code><br>→ domains match, SPF alignment passes.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="info-card">
                <div class="ic-head bad-head">Unaligned — fails DMARC</div>
                <p>Envelope-from: <code>bounce@mailchimp.com</code><br>Header From: <code>example.com</code><br>→ domains differ, SPF alignment fails (even though SPF itself passed on mailchimp.com).</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>This is why services like Mailchimp, HubSpot, and SendGrid require separate DKIM configuration — they use their own envelope domain, so DKIM is the only alignment path available.</p>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>DKIM setup per ESP</h3>
            <p>Every service that sends on your behalf needs to sign with DKIM using a key scoped to your domain. Where to find this in each platform:</p>
            <div class="esp-table">
              <table>
                <thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Where to configure</th><th>DNS record type</th></tr></thead>

                  <tr><td>Google Workspace</td><td>Admin console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Authenticate email</td><td>TXT at <code>google._domainkey</code></td></tr>
                  <tr><td>Microsoft 365</td><td>Defender portal → Email &amp; collaboration → Policies → DKIM</td><td>Two CNAME records (<code>selector1</code>, <code>selector2</code>)</td></tr>

                  <tr><td>ActiveCampaign</td><td>Settings → Advanced → Email authentication</td><td>TXT record provided</td></tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </div>
            <p>After publishing the DNS record, allow 24–48 hours for propagation before checking alignment in the Sentinel DMARC Analytics view.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>The SPF 10-lookup limit</h3>
            <p>SPF has a hard limit of 10 DNS lookups when evaluating a record. Each <code>include:</code> directive counts as one lookup, and some includes nest further includes. Exceeding 10 causes SPF to return <code>permerror</code>, which means SPF fails — regardless of whether the sender is authorised.</p>
            <p><strong>How to diagnose it:</strong> In the DMARC Analytics source table, look for a sender showing SPF alignment failures with an explanation mentioning "too many DNS lookups" or "PermError".</p>
            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use an SPF flattening tool to resolve all <code>include:</code> directives to their constituent IP ranges and publish them directly. Update the flat record whenever your ESPs change their IP ranges (subscribe to their change notifications).</p>
            <div class="callout warn">
              SPF flattening is a maintenance burden. If you have more than 5 sending services, consider whether all of them still send mail from your domain — decommissioning unused ESPs is simpler than flattening.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>When to advance policy</h3>
            <p>The safe advancement gate is <strong>95% DMARC compliance for 30 consecutive days</strong>. This means 95 out of every 100 messages sent by your legitimate senders pass DMARC authentication.</p>
            <p>The DMARC record diff view (Roadmap → current domain) shows the gate status. All three gates must be green before advancing:</p>
            <div class="gate-list">
              <div class="gate"><span class="g-ok">✓</span> Primary senders aligned — no authorised sender is failing DMARC</div>
              <div class="gate"><span class="g-ok">✓</span> At least 30 days of report data collected</div>
              <div class="gate"><span class="g-ok">✓</span> Compliance rate ≥ 95% — safe to advance without disrupting legitimate mail</div>
            </div>
            <p>If a sender is still failing alignment, fix that sender first. Advancing policy while senders are misaligned will move their mail to spam (at quarantine) or reject it entirely (at reject).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Subdomain policy</h3>
            <p>The <code>p=</code> tag applies to the organisational domain. Subdomains inherit the parent policy unless you set a separate <code>sp=</code> (subdomain policy) tag.</p>
            <div class="code-block"><pre>v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=quarantine; rua=mailto:abc123@mailsentry.co.za;</pre></div>
            <p>Common scenario: you want strict enforcement on your main domain but a softer policy on subdomains you use for internal tooling that isn't yet aligned. Set <code>sp=quarantine</code> while you fix the subdomain senders, then remove the <code>sp=</code> tag once they're aligned.</p>
            <p>Sentinel currently tracks the organisational domain policy. Subdomain-specific overrides are visible in the raw DMARC record but are not separately scored.</p>

            <h3>What MTA-STS protects against</h3>
            <p>DMARC protects your domain's reputation as a sender. MTA-STS protects your domain as a receiver. Without MTA-STS, a network attacker between a sender's mail server and your MX host can:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Strip the STARTTLS negotiation (downgrade attack), forcing mail to be delivered in plaintext</li>
              <li>Present a forged certificate for your MX host, intercepting encrypted mail</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MTA-STS solves this by publishing a signed policy that tells senders: "you must use TLS to deliver to my domain, and you must verify the certificate." Senders that support MTA-STS enforce this policy before delivering mail.</p>
            <div class="callout info">
              MTA-STS only protects inbound mail from senders that implement the standard. Major providers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo) all do. Smaller or legacy servers may not — that's what TLS-RPT reporting reveals.

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Why certificate health matters</h3>
            <p>A TLS certificate is the proof of identity that your MX host presents when a sender attempts to deliver mail over TLS. In MTA-STS testing mode, certificate failures are logged but mail is delivered anyway. In <strong>enforce mode, a certificate failure causes the sender to queue mail and retry</strong> — it will not deliver over an insecure or unverifiable connection.</p>
            <p>Certificate problems are therefore a delivery risk, not just a monitoring concern.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Certificate statuses</h3>
            <div class="status-list">
              <div class="status-row">
                <span class="status-badge st-ok">ok</span>
                <div>Certificate is valid, trusted, matches the hostname, and has more than 30 days remaining. No action required.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="status-row">
                <span class="status-badge st-soon">expiring_soon</span>
                <div>Certificate expires within 30 days. Renew now — don't wait. Automated renewal (Let's Encrypt / ACME) should have already triggered; check if it failed.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="status-row">
                <span class="status-badge st-crit">critical</span>
                <div>Certificate expires within 7 days. Immediate action required. If you're on MTA-STS enforce, expiry will cause delivery failures at this MX host.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="status-row">
                <span class="status-badge st-exp">expired</span>
                <div>Certificate has expired. If MTA-STS is at enforce, MTA-STS-compliant senders cannot deliver to this MX host until the certificate is replaced. Replace immediately.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="status-row">
                <span class="status-badge st-err">error</span>
                <div>The probe could not connect to the host, could not complete TLS negotiation, or encountered an unhandled error. The host may be down, firewalled, or on a non-standard port. Check connectivity manually.</div>

          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Hostname mismatch</h3>
            <p>A hostname mismatch means the certificate presented by the MX host does not include the MX hostname in its Subject Alternative Names (SAN) list or Common Name (CN).</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your MX record points to <code>mail.yourdomain.com</code>. The certificate covers <code>*.yourhostingprovider.com</code> but not <code>mail.yourdomain.com</code>. MTA-STS-enforcing senders will refuse to deliver because they cannot verify the identity of the host.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution options:</strong></p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Add <code>mail.yourdomain.com</code> to the certificate's SAN list (requires control of the certificate)</li>
              <li>Ask your hosting provider to issue a certificate that covers your MX hostname</li>
              <li>Use a mail service that issues certificates matching the hostnames they present (e.g. Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Fastmail)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout warn">
              The Common Name (CN) field is deprecated for hostname matching in modern TLS. Only the SAN list is checked. A certificate with your hostname only in the CN and not in the SAN will show as a hostname mismatch.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Deprecated TLS versions</h3>
            <p>TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated (RFC 8996). Using them is a security risk — they have known vulnerabilities and cannot be considered secure for mail delivery.</p>
            <p>Sentinel surfaces the negotiated TLS version for each MX host. If you see <code>TLSv1.0</code> or <code>TLSv1.1</code>:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>This is a server configuration issue, not a certificate issue</li>
              <li>Contact your mail host or hosting provider to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and enable TLS 1.2 and 1.3</li>
              <li>If you control the server, update the <code>ssl_protocols</code> (Nginx) or <code>SSLProtocol</code> (Apache) directive</li>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>STARTTLS</h3>
            <p>STARTTLS is the mechanism by which an SMTP connection upgrades from plaintext to TLS. Your MX host must advertise STARTTLS in its EHLO response for senders to use TLS at all.</p>
            <p>Sentinel's certificate probe checks whether STARTTLS is supported. If <code>starttls_supported: false</code>:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>TLS is not available for inbound delivery to this MX host</li>
              <li>MTA-STS enforce mode cannot work — senders will queue and retry indefinitely</li>
              <li>This must be fixed at the mail server level before MTA-STS can be used</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The white-label PDF report</h3>
            <p>The PDF report is the primary deliverable for MSP client communication. It contains:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Sentinel Score with grade and week-over-week delta</li>
              <li>Executive narrative (AI-generated, 3 sentences, board-readable)</li>
              <li>Threat surface summary — impersonation attempts blocked vs exposed</li>
              <li>Per-domain grade table with DMARC stage, MTA-STS stage, compliance rate, and primary issue</li>
              <li>Sender inventory (authorised compliant, authorised non-compliant, unauthorised)</li>
              <li>Prioritised recommendation list with effort/impact ratings</li>
              <li>Score trend chart (last 8 weeks)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On MSP and Enterprise plans, the report header can be branded with the MSP's name and logo by setting <code>brand_name</code> and <code>brand_logo_url</code> on the client tenant.</p>
            <p>The report is generated on demand from the Overview page (Report button) and from the <code>GET /overview/report-data</code> API endpoint. MSPs typically generate and send one report per client per month.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio view</h3>
            <p>The MSP Clients list is a portfolio view — a single screen showing the security posture of all client tenants. Each row shows:</p>
            <div class="field-list">
              <div class="fl-row"><span class="fl-k">Sentinel Score</span><span>0–100 composite score for that client's domains</span></div>

              <div class="fl-row"><span class="fl-k">Cert alerts</span><span>Number of domains with certificate issues requiring attention</span></div>
            </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Domain pooling on the MSP plan</h3>
            <p>The MSP plan includes 150 domains pooled across all client tenants. A single client can use any number of those 150 domains. There is no per-client domain limit — the limit is on the MSP account's total.</p>
            <p>If you need more than 150 domains total, contact sales for an Enterprise plan or a custom domain add-on.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Client billing: pooled by default, independent if they outgrow you</h3>
            <p>A client tenant starts on the Free plan, billed entirely through your MSP plan's domain pool — most clients never need anything else. But a client tenant is a real, independent workspace, and its own admin can subscribe to their own Starter/Pro/MSP plan directly from their Billing settings, completely separate from your account. This matters for the case where a client outgrows the relationship — they keep their data and history, they just start paying for their own plan instead of drawing from your pool.</p>
            <div class="callout info">
              You're not charged for a client's independent subscription, and they're not charged for being part of your pool — the two billing relationships don't overlap. If you remove a client that has its own active subscription, that subscription is cancelled automatically as part of the removal, so it never keeps billing a card with no account left behind it.
            </div>
            <p>You can't currently see from the MSP Clients list whether a given client has self-upgraded — if this matters for how you manage a relationship, ask the client directly or check with them before assuming their usage is still drawing from your pool.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Onboarding many clients at once</h3>
            <p>Adding domains supports pasting a comma- or newline-separated list, or uploading a CSV/text file directly — see <a href="#" @click.prevent="activeSection = 'account-security'">Account &amp; Security</a> for the exact format. For an MSP bringing on a new client with an existing domain portfolio, this means one import instead of clicking through the wizard once per domain.</p>

            <p>The Sentinel Score is a portfolio-level number (0–100) computed from three pillars. When domains have mail volume data, the score is <strong>volume-weighted</strong> — higher-traffic domains count more because a security gap on a high-volume domain is more consequential than the same gap on a low-traffic domain.</p>

            <h3>Using the score in client reports</h3>
            <p>The Sentinel Score is designed to be the single number you put in front of a non-technical client. To explain it:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li><strong>Grade A / Score 90+:</strong> "Your email security is fully enforced. We are blocking impersonation attempts and inbound delivery is protected."</li>
              <li><strong>Grade B / Score 75–89:</strong> "Strong posture with minor gaps. We are working through the remaining domains to reach full enforcement."</li>
              <li><strong>Grade C or below:</strong> "Significant gaps remain. [Number] of your domains are not yet at full enforcement — this is the focus of the next period's work."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The score trend (shown in the PDF report as a weekly sparkline) tells the story of progress over time. A rising score across a quarter is a clear demonstration of value from your MSP service.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>How this connects to recommendations</h3>
            <p>The same gates described above — DMARC compliance ≥ 95% for 30 days, TLS pass rate ≥ 99% for 14 days, certificate runway ≥ 30 days — aren't just used to calculate the score. They're the exact rule set the <a href="#" @click.prevent="activeSection = 'account-security'">recommendation engine</a> uses to decide when it's safe to suggest advancing a domain's enforcement stage. The alert bell, the PDF report's recommendation list, and the Roadmap page's "why can't I advance yet" panel all read from this one rule set — there's no separate AI judgment call about whether advancing is safe. An AI advisor may explain a recommendation in plain language, but it never decides whether to make one.</p>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Terms acceptance at signup</h3>
            <p>Creating an account — either by registering directly or by accepting a team invite — requires checking a box agreeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This is recorded with a timestamp and the specific terms version you agreed to, not just a yes/no flag, so it can be reproduced later if the terms ever materially change.</p>
            <p>Being invited onto an existing workspace by an admin still requires you, personally, to accept terms when you set your password — an admin inviting you isn't treated as consent on your behalf.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Email verification</h3>
            <p>New accounts created via direct registration start <strong>unverified</strong>. This is soft-gated by design: you can use the app immediately, but you'll see a dismissible banner prompting you to confirm your email address, with a one-click resend.</p>
            <div class="callout info">
              Accounts created by accepting a team invite, or created directly by an MSP admin, start already verified — receiving and clicking the invite link is itself proof you control that email address, so there's nothing further to confirm.
            </div>
            <p>Verification links expire after 24 hours. Requesting a new one automatically invalidates any link sent before it, so only the most recent email is ever live.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Forgotten password</h3>
            <p>The sign-in page has a "Forgot password?" link. Submitting your email always returns the same response — "if an account with that email exists, a reset link has been sent" — regardless of whether the address is actually registered. This is deliberate: a different response for known vs. unknown emails would let someone enumerate which addresses have accounts.</p>
            <div class="steps">
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">1</span><div>Request a reset link by email.</div></div>
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">2</span><div>Click the link (valid for 30 minutes, single-use — requesting a new one invalidates the previous link).</div></div>
              <div class="step"><span class="step-num">3</span><div>Choose a new password. You'll be signed out of your current session and need to sign back in with it.</div></div>
            </div>
            <p>Single sign-on (SSO) accounts have no password to reset — this flow only applies to accounts created with a password.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>What changing your password actually does to your session</h3>
            <p>Sentinel's sign-in tokens are stateless — there's no server-side list of "currently valid" tokens to check on every request. Instead, each account carries an internal counter that's embedded in every token it issues. Changing your password, resetting it, or enabling/disabling two-factor authentication increments that counter, which makes <strong>every previously issued token for that account stop working immediately</strong> — including the one you're using right now.</p>
            <p>In practice: after changing your password from your account settings, you'll be signed out and asked to sign in again with the new one. This is correct behavior, not a bug — it's what makes "change your password" actually mean something if your account was compromised, rather than just changing the password while a stolen session token keeps working.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Exporting your data</h3>
            <p>From Settings, you can download a JSON export of your account, workspace, team members, and a summary of each monitored domain's DMARC/TLS/certificate status. This is scoped to summary-level data — compliance percentages, volume, certificate status — not a row-by-row dump of every raw report ever ingested, since that's rarely what a data export request is actually asking for and can run into tens of thousands of rows per domain.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Bulk domain import</h3>
            <p>When adding domains, you're not limited to typing them one at a time. Paste a comma- or newline-separated list directly into the domain field, or use <strong>Import from CSV or text file</strong> to upload a file — one domain per line, or a comma-separated row exported from a spreadsheet. A header row like "domain" or "name" is recognised and skipped automatically rather than queued as an (invalid) domain.</p>
            <p>Every domain in the list goes through the same DMARC check → TLS setup → confirm flow as a single domain, just looped — useful for an MSP onboarding a new client's entire domain portfolio in one pass rather than clicking through the wizard repeatedly.</p>

            <h3>Availability</h3>
            <p>Audit Log is an <strong>Enterprise plan</strong> feature. It's always visible in the sidebar regardless of plan — on a lower tier it shows a lock icon and links through to an upgrade prompt rather than disappearing entirely, so you know the feature exists before you need to ask.</p>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>What gets logged</h3>
            <p>The audit log is written by explicit calls at known, security-relevant action points — not a generic "log every request" capture. That's a deliberate tradeoff: a generic capture logs the HTTP layer ("PATCH /domains/abc123"), which isn't reconstructible into "what actually happened" without cross-referencing code. Explicit logging captures the actual event ("advanced example.com from quarantine to reject") in a form a non-engineer reviewing the log can read directly.</p>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>What you can see per entry</h3>
            <p>Each entry shows when it happened, who did it (by email — preserved even if that user is later removed from the workspace), the action, and what it was done to. Where relevant, the entry also records the before/after state of what changed (e.g. a role change shows the old and new role).</p>
            <div class="callout info">
              If a tenant is deleted entirely, its audit history is not preserved as a queryable log in the app — there would be no workspace left to view it from. The deletion event itself is recorded in the application's own system logs rather than the in-app audit log, for exactly this reason.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Filtering</h3>
            <p>The audit log can be filtered by action type if you're looking for a specific category of event (e.g. only billing changes, or only team membership changes) rather than scrolling the full history.</p>
